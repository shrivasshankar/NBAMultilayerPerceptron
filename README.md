# NBAMultilayerPerceptron
I made a multiplayer perceptron model in R and trained it based on the question if we can predict a player scores above average without knowing how much he scored and only based of his other stats such as minutes played, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, and shooting attempts/makes. It classifes accuratly about 81% of the time and has 90% accuracy.
